# LINUX_JOURNEY
This will be short documentation of my Linux journey

I plan on including nearly everything, starting from my first command, `cd`, which of course I first learnt when working with the windows command line.

## The First Steps
I started by reading documentation about what Linux is.
I managed to understand that what most people call linux is actually just the **Kernel**.
The **Kerenal** is simply what is responsible for interacting with the hardware of the computer.
What most people call the Linux operating system is simply the kernal combined with other software.


## The Way Forward
This was a demo for Penjani!!
