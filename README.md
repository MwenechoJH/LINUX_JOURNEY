# LINUX_JOURNEY
This will be short documentation of my Linux journey

I plan on including nearly everything, starting from my first command, `cd`, which of course I first learnt when working with the windows command line.

## The First Steps
I started by reading documentation about what Linux is.
I managed to understand that what most people call linux is actually just the **Kernel**.
The **Kerenal** is simply what is responsible for interacting with the hardware of the computer.
What most people call the Linux operating system is simply the kernal combined with other software.

## Commands
When working with the linux terminal, we normlly deal with commands. In my own understanding, these are short and structured phrases used to interact with the system.
The first commands i was intrduced to are:
`cd`
`pwd`
`whoami`
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt upgrade`

Flags are also anther thing used together with these commands. e.g. `-l`, `-o`, `-q`


## Navigation
After learning the Secrets of what Linux is, I delved into navigation of the system. During which I learnt basic commands like:
`pwd` -Which prints the *current working directory*
`cd` - Which simply *changes the working directory*
`ls` - Which lists all the directories and files in a directory
`rm` - This removes a file
`mkdir` this created a directory
`rmdir` - this deletes an empty directory


## File Handling
`touch` this is used to create file
`cat` - this is used to read a file
`nano` - this command is used to open the nano editor which is one of the default file editors in linux
